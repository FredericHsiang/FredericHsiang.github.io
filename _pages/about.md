<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I became a searcherÔºåwanting to find out who I was and what made me unique. My view of myself was changing. I wanted a solid base to start from. I started to resist3 pressure to act in ways that I didn‚Äôt like any moreÔºåand I was delighted by who I really was. I came to feel much more sure that no one can ever take my place. Each of us holds a unique place in the world. You are specialÔºåno matter what others say or what you may think. So forget about being replaced. You can‚Äôt be.
